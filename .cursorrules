Project-wide Cursor rules

- Use Bun for all package management and runtime commands in this repo.
- Do NOT use npm, yarn, or pnpm.

Command mapping

- Install dependencies: `bun install`
- Run package scripts: `bun run <script>`
- Execute CLIs (instead of npx): `bunx <cli>`
- Run TypeScript/Node files directly: `bun <file.ts>`
- When a script expects Node, prefer Bun runtime flags as needed (e.g., `bun run -b <script>`).

Additional notes

- When generating commands in tasks, default to Bun equivalents.
- When suggesting developer instructions or README snippets, prefer Bun commands.
